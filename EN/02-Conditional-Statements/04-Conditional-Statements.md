# Simple Conditions
Often we have to check certain conditions and take action according to the result

```python
if condition: 
  # Code for execution
  # if the condition is true
```

The result is either ***True*** or ***False***

# Indentation
Leading whitespace is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which is used to determine the grouping of statements.
```python
   name = "John"
if name == "John": 
  print(name)
# Indentation Error
```
```python
name = "John"
if name == "John": 
  print(name)  #John
# Correct Indentation
```

[task-description]
Write a program, which:

* Reads a temperature in Celsius
* **Checks** whether the temperature is **below zero**
* Prints ***"Freezing weather!"***, if the temperature is equal or lower than 0, otherwise print ***"No output"***
